# Double-handed-Sailing-Game
This repository does not contain all of the project's code. It only includes the files from the C++ Classes directory, which are the most straightforward and readable files. Other files that are not automatically generated by Unreal Engine 5 (UE5) are more complex and require UE5 to open, as they tend to be large and cluttered with data that is not easily interpretable outside of the engine.

For the full project and a complete overview of all assets, it is recommended to open the project within Unreal Engine 5.
